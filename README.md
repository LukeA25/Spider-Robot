# Spider Robot

Made up of 12 servos and 14 3D-printed parts, this mechanical spider can walk forward or backward, and turn left or right. It also has a Bluetooth chip, so it can be controlled by a laptop connected to the spider via Bluetooth.

## Source Code

The code for the spider is written in C++, and the code for the computer controller is in Python. This also has the 3D models used to print the spider.
